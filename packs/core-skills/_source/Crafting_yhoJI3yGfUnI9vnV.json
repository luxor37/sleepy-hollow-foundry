    "description": "<p>Crafting is essential for repairing items, creating new tools, or understanding and manipulating mechanical devices. It involves tasks such as fixing a broken carriage wheel or fashioning a makeshift trap.</p><p>You make a <strong>Crafting test</strong> when you attempt to repair, create, or modify an item. If multiple people are working on the same project, you can transfer your successes to others, improving their chances of success.</p><h3>Extra Successes Can Be Used To:</h3><ul><li><strong>Speed Up Work</strong> – Complete the task in a fraction of the usual time.</li><li><strong>Improve Quality</strong> – Enhance the durability or functionality of the crafted item.</li><li><strong>Identify Weak Points</strong> – Detect flaws or vulnerabilities in a device or structure.</li><li><strong>Modify Design</strong> – Alter the design to better suit a specific need or condition.</li><li><strong>Repurpose Materials</strong> – Use available materials more efficiently, reducing waste.</li></ul>",
