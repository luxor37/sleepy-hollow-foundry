It governs aiming, shooting accuracy, and handling firearms under pressure.</p><p>You make a <strong>Marksmanship test</strong> when attempting to hit a target at a distance, whether during a hunt or in combat. If multiple people are attacking the same target, you may transfer your successes to others, improving their chances of success.</p><h3>Extra Successes Can Be Used To:</h3><ul><li><strong>Increase Damage</strong> – Inflict additional harm on your target.</li><li><strong>Called Shots</strong> – Aim for specific body parts to incapacitate or hinder the target.</li><li><strong>Pin Down</strong> – Force the target to seek cover, reducing their mobility.</li><li><strong>Suppress</strong> – Make the target hesitant to attack, reducing their effectiveness.</li><li><strong>Ricochet</strong> – Hit multiple targets with a single shot, if plausible.</li></ul>",
